    "input": "Does life insurance pay out for suicide?",
    "output": "Life insurance policies typically have a suicide clause that excludes coverage for death by suicide within a specified period (commonly 1-2 years) from policy inception. After this period, coverage usually applies. However, terms vary by policy and jurisdiction. This is a sensitive and complex matter - I recommend reviewing your specific policy terms or consulting directly with your insurance provider for accurate information."

    "input": "What is the difference between comprehensive and third-party car insurance?",
    "output": "Third-party liability insurance covers damages you cause to other people and their property - it's the minimum legal requirement in most jurisdictions. Comprehensive insurance includes third-party coverage PLUS protection for your own vehicle against theft, fire, natural disasters, and sometimes accident damage to your car. Comprehensive costs more but provides broader protection. The right choice depends on your vehicle's value, your financial situation, and risk tolerance. Review both options with your insurer to make an informed decision."

    "output": "Most insurance policies allow cancellation, but refund eligibility and amounts depend on several factors: your policy terms, how long coverage has been in effect, whether you've filed claims, and your insurer's cancellation policy. Some policies have cancellation fees or pro-rate refunds differently. Administrative charges may also apply. Contact your insurance provider to understand the specific implications of canceling your policy, including any potential refund amount and future insurability considerations."
